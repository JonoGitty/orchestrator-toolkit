AI Orchestrator — Elevator Pitch (One Pager)

What it is
AI Orchestrator is a cross-platform AI system controller that turns natural
language into working software and immediate system actions. It reads a prompt,
generates a structured project plan, builds and runs the project, and provides
an interactive command console to control apps, files, and core system tasks.

What it does
- Converts prompts into runnable projects (Python, web apps, CLIs, tools).
- Writes files, installs dependencies, and creates launchers automatically.
- Runs the result immediately and logs output for quick iteration.
- Offers an interactive shell for system actions (apps, wifi, window control).
- Keeps project output organized with Save/Delete/Keep policies.

Why it matters
It collapses the gap between idea and execution. Instead of switching between
chat, editor, terminal, and browser, the orchestrator becomes the single place
where ideas are built, run, and managed.

Future development
The long-term vision is an adaptive GUI that encompasses the entire workflow:
- A unified interface that shows only what you need, when you need it.
- Embedded webviews for generated web apps (no context switching).
- Expandable panels and an HUD-style layout for deep system visibility.
- Voice control and intent-driven actions layered on top of the same API.
- A Linux-first "OS-like" mode where all interaction flows through the
  orchestrator, while preserving cross-platform support today.

Status
This is a living project. The core generator and command console already work,
and the UI layer is evolving toward a single, adaptive control surface.
