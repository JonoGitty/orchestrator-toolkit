# Analysis Parameters

<!-- Define the parameters, thresholds, and criteria for your analysis. -->
<!-- These are the values Claude Code needs to write correct geoprocessing scripts. -->

## Buffer Distances

<!-- e.g. Roads: 500m, Rivers: 100m, Buildings: 50m -->

## Classification Thresholds

<!-- e.g. Slope < 15 degrees = suitable, Elevation 100-500m = suitable -->

## Spatial Relationships

<!-- e.g. Parcels WITHIN zoning polygons, Points WITHIN_A_DISTANCE 1km of roads -->

## Output Requirements

<!-- e.g. Dissolve by region, Calculate area in hectares, Include count per zone -->

## Map Symbology

<!-- e.g. Graduated colors by population, Unique values by land use type -->

## Export Settings

<!-- e.g. PDF at 300 DPI, PNG at 150 DPI, Layout size A3 landscape -->
